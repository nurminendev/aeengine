	* *************** *
	*** 0.1 RELEASE ***
	* *************** *

	* Changed the PACKAGE_TARNAME in configure.ac to 'aeengine' and tweaked 'make dist' a bit more.

	* Added -rdynamic to the LDFLAGS in ae-config. This seemed to break a lot of things (?).

	* Fixed a memleak in the registry that happened when a plugin could not be loaded and the app
	bailed out.

2003-03-01  Riku Nurminen

	* Removed the AC_HEADER_STD C-standard library check from configure.ac as those libraries are
	not used by AE.

	* Added materialpool to the registry. The materials created by user were never deleted before.
	Fixed. Thanks go to the new memory manager for revealing this leak.

2003-02-28  Riku Nurminen

	* Added to most of the classes the AECF_CDNEF and AECF_CNAME macros which are used my the
	memory manager.

	* The new operator never got overwritten so that the memory manager would be used. Fixed that.
	Thanks swente for pointing it out. Woops :)

	* Removed aeCTimer and made new aeTimer.

	* Removed the global self_ptr from aeEngine and added another to aeRegistry. This is better
	because now we have global access to all the subsystems instead of only the engine.

	* Removed the unnecessary opengl and sdl cflags from the memory manager compilation.

	* Moved aeUtil::ASSERT to aeBase and modified it to use the new logger for output. Changed all
	the source files that call ASSERT aswell.

	* Changed most of the old aeUtil::Report() calls to use the new logger.

	* Added new aeBase base class. This class includes the new logging functionality (thanks again
	swente!) and each class that wants to use the logger should derive from this class.

2003-02-27  Riku Nurminen

	* Changed the order of ldflags so that -laereg is before -laeengine as otherwise it broke some
	things.

	* Added AE_APPLICATION macro that *must* be included at global scope, in the file that contains
	main() in an AE application. This macro instantiates the memory manager and will probably take
	care of other stuff also in the future.

	* aedefs.h must now be included in *EVERY* source file (be it an application using the AE api
	or an engine-inside whatever). If you don't need the video stuff includes you can
	#define ONLY_INCLUDE_STD before #include <aedefs.h>.

	* Added a new memory manager library contributed by swente <ssuebert@web.de>, thanks! This
	should sufficiently ease the tracking of mem leaks.

	* Added few missing \n's.

2003-02-26  Riku Nurminen

	* Updated API docs (also switched them to .php for future use of php header). Updated the web
	docs too.

	* aeMD2Object and aeModelLoader now use a aeVector3 and aeTexCoord2 vector containers to store
	vertices & texcoords. This also makes the model loader now compatible with the (broken :)
	frustum culler.

	* Changed the vertex list, vertex color list, and vertex texcoord list vectors in aeObject
	to contain pointers instead of non-pointers. The vectors themselves are also now pointers. This
	makes it easier for the aeObject to be compatible with the model loader. I don't see anything
	bad this could cause (as long as those pointers are carefully taken care of).

	* Separated the types from aedefs.h into new file include/aetypes.h.

2003-02-24  Riku Nurminen

	* Added Set() and Unit() to aeVector and aeVector3 and added aeVector4 with the previous
	changes included.

	* Added some missing operators to the vector classes and inlined the operators aswell.

	* Added new class aeTexCoord2.

	* Added aeObject::IsTransparent() and aeObject::GetMaterial().

	* Added aeModel::IsAnimating().

	* Removed much useless stuff from aeModel and aeMD2Object (stuff that is already implemented
	in aeObject).

	* Moved include/aegeom/md2object.h to include/aemdlldr/md2object.h and
	src/libs/aegeom/md2object.cpp to src/plugins/aemdlldr/md2object.cpp. We only want to compile
	it if the plugin is wanted (otherwise it would be useless). This won't of course make much
	difference until disabling of plugins is implemented (it will be soon! or when I get to it :)).

	* Changed the names of the following API functions:
	 - aeEngine::NumObjects() to aeEngine::GetObjectCount()
	 - aeEngine::NumTextures() to aeEngine::GetTextureCount()
	 - aeObject::NumVertices() to aeObject::GetVertexCount()
	 - aeMaterial::GetTexCount() to aeMaterial::GetTextureCount()

	* scripts/cl: Now counts makefiles too. And the apps under apps/*.

	* Moved include/aeengine/glproc.h to include/aeengine/win32/glproc.h and
	src/libs/aeengine/glproc.cpp to src/libs/aeengine/win32/glproc.cpp. We only take those in if
	we are on win32.

	* Added own Makefiles for each of the engine libraries and plugins.

	* Added SphereInFrustum() and CubeInFrustum() to aeFrustumCuller and modified the engine
	visibility testing to use those.

	* Added GetBoundingSphereRadius() to aeObject. This is used by the frustum culler.

2003-02-22  Riku Nurminen

	* Added pluginpool to the registry so that the plugins' destructors can and actually get
	called too. Also the objects' destructors were never called.. woops. Fixed that too.

	* Changed some lurking malloc/free calls to new/delete.

	* Moved all the common stuff from the object classes into aeObject. This makes it easier to
	add things to the objects as you don't have to add the same stuff into 5 different places.

2003-02-21  Riku Nurminen

	* Added -fomit-frame-pointer to CFLAGS in optimize build mode.

2003-02-20  Riku Nurminen

	* Fixed a silly bug in the BMP loader.

	* Added NumVertices() and GetVertex() to the geometry classes (aeLine, aePolygon, ...).

	* Added simple frustum culling. This is still a lot work to be done.

	* ***************** *
	*** 0.0.5 RELEASE ***
	* ***************** *

2003-02-08  Riku Nurminen

	* 'make dist' now produces tar.gz, tar.bz2 and md5sum into the dist/ directory.

2003-02-05    <Rakkis@KIWI>

	* Lots of win32 fixes. Added msvc6 project files (compiles now, but aetest segfaults).

2003-02-05  Riku Nurminen

	* Reorganized aetest a bit.

	* Removed some unnecessary textures from data/ and added RLE compressed smile.tga.

	* Fixed the texture loader so it no longer produces strange graphical artifacts to
	TGA textures.

2003-02-03  Riku Nurminen

	* The plugin entry symbols now return aePlugin* instead of void*, as they should.

	* Changed the plugin entry symbol from CREATE_PLUGIN to PLUGIN_ENTRY.

	* Added check for dlfcn.h in configure.ac and modified registry.cpp accordingly.

2003-02-02  Riku Nurminen

	* Removed GL/glx.h from aedefs.h as it's not needed at all.

	* aeTriangle, aeQuad, aePolygon, aeMD2Object win32 & glProc tunings

	* Added glProc for windows to store pointers to some gl functions.

	* Finally removed the public engine pointer from aeCamera. There's now globally
	accessible aeEngine::self_ptr that the camera uses (thanks swente).

	* Added check for AEROOT in configure.

	* Added own Makefile.in for apps/aetest.

	* Added autogen.sh.

	* Added check for SDL in configure.ac and modified the makefiles accordingly.

	* Added ae-config script to help produce compiling options for apps. Changed the aetest
	app to use the script.

	* Added MDL_CHECK_OPENGL to configure.ac and modified the makefiles to use the check results.

	* The makefiles now use the EXEEXT and OBJEXT variables from autoconf.

2003-02-02    <Rakkis@KIWI>

	* Added include/glext.h and did various win32 cleanups and fixes. Doesn't compile in windows
	at the moment but will soon...

2003-02-01  Riku Nurminen

	* Fixed the multitexturing functionality in aeLine, aeQuad, aeTriangle and aePolygon.

	* src/libs/aesys/system.cpp: Added SetWindowCaption() to change the
	window icon name and caption.

2003-01-25  Riku Nurminen

	* ae: initial version.
